Relationship: A positive relationship means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase and vice versa. In the context of the Analysis, it can be said that in a positive relationship, as latitude (x-axis) increases (moving away from the equator), other variables dennoted by 'y-axis', i.e., Temperature, Humidity,cloudiness and Wind speed, tends to increase. This is often the case, as generally expect higher temperatures near the equator and lower temperatures as you move towards the poles and the opposite can be said to be true. 

R-Value (Coefficient of Determination): The coefficient of determination, denoted as "r-squared" (r^2), measures how well the variation in the dependent variable (dennoted by 'y-axis', i.e., Temperature, Humidity,cloudiness and Wind speed) can be explained by the independent variable (in this case, 'Latitude') using a linear regression model. A high r-squared value, close to 1, indicates that a large proportion of the variation in 'Max Temp' can be explained by 'Latitude.' In other words, if the linear regression line does a good job of fitting the data, and there is a strong linear correlation between the variables.

So, when there is a positive relationship and a high r-squared value usually above 0.5, it suggests that the change in one variable (Latitude) is a good predictor of the change in the other variable, and this relationship is positive. Meaning that:
    1. As Latitude increases, Max Temperature tends to increase, and as Latitude decreases, Max Temperature tends to decrease in the northern Hermisphere.
    2. As Latitude decreases, Max Temperature tends to increase in the sothern Hermisphere with an r-value of 0.546 suggests that there is a moderate positive correlation between the two variables.
